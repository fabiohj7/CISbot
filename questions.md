(a)  
2. What is a .a file in C?  
1. it's a static library in C  
2. it's an archive file which has object code  
3. it's a dynamic library in C  
4. it's a zip file  
(a,b)  
3. What is true about selection sort?  
1. it has time complexity of O(n^2)  
2. it is an in place sorting algorithm (does not require extra space)  
3. it works by finding the smallest unsorted value and moves it to the correct location  
4. it has time complexity of O(n^3)  
(a,b,c)  
4. What is true about pipes?  
1. they require a temp file to store data  
2. they can only connect 2 commands  
3. they write data to the disk  
4. they are bidirectional  
(none)  
5. What is true about SIGALRM?  
1. it is a signal sent after an alarm duration occurs  
2. it can be used to pause a process  
3. it can be used to warn a user how much time they have remaining in a session  
4. it can be used with a logout function to log a user out after a time elapses  
(a,b,c,d)  
6. What are valid ways to delete something from an array in C?  
1. There is a built-in array.delete() function.  
2. Reassigning each entry in the array (after the one you want to delete) to the index previous to it.  
3. Descreasing the size of the array.  
4. Setting the index of what you want to delete to NULL.  
(b)  
7. What are true statements about the alarm() function in C?  
1. A new alarm() function call will override the current alarm.  
2. Setting a new alarm to zero with alarm(0) will stop the alarm.  
3. An alarm cannot be overridden.  
4. Multiple alarms can be set to run at the same time.  
(a,b)  
8. What does strcmp() return?  
1. Only 0 and 1.  
2. Only -1, 0, and 1.  
3. The lesser string in the comparison.  
4. The greater string in the comparison.  
(none)  
9. When opening a file using FILE* readFile = fopen("filename.txt", "r"), when will the file pointer, readFile, be equal to NULL?  
1. It will be NULL if there is nothing in the selected file.  
2. It will be NULL if the selected file only has whitespace.  
3. It will be NULL if the selected file does not exist.  
4. It will be NULL if there are null-terminating characters in the selected file.  
(c)  
10. What are differences between switch/case and if/else?  
1. If/else only checks the condition once whereas switch/case checks the condition for each case.  
2. If/else evaluates the condition for each else-if, wheres switch/case evaluates the condition once and then checks which case matches the result.  
3. For a program with many options, using a switch/case is faster than if/else  
4. If/else needs curly braces {} for each else-if, whereas switch/case uses a colon : for each case  
(b,c,d)  
11. How long does alarm(10) last for?

2. 10 minutes  
3. 10 hours  
4. 10 days  
(a)  
12. Which of these can read integer inputs?  
1. %d  
2. %i  
3. $f  
4. %x  
(a,b)  
13. Which of these are data types in C?  
1. long int  
2. int  
3. char  
4. double  
(a,b,c,d)  
14. Which of the following are valid loops in C  
1. for loop  
2. while loop  
3. nested loop  
4. do-while loop  
(a,b,c,d)  
15. What is a signal in UNIX, and how is it used in a C program?  
1. A signal is a way to terminate processes automatically.  
2. A signal is a software interrupt sent to a program to indicate an event has occurre4.  
3. A signal is used to start a new process.  
4. A signal is a data structure used to store system call information.  
(b)  
16. What is a valid way of using the alarm() function?  
1. alarm(1)  
2. alarm(5)  
3. A(10)  
4. alarms(3)  
(a,b)

1. Terminate  
2. Interupt  
3. Suspend  
4. Execute  
(a,b,c)  
18. What does the signal() function ask for?  
1. Computer signal  
2. Wifi signal  
3. Keyboard signal  
4. Makefile signal  
(none)  
19. Which of the following is true about using a selection sort?  
1. Sorts an array by repeatedly choosing the smallest or largest element from the unsorted portion and swapping it with the first unsorted element
